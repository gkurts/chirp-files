# Chirp files for various areas that I've been to.

* I'm just getting into Ham Radio. These are some of the files I've begun to accumulate.
* Includes CSV and IMG files.
* I use these in a UV-5R but any radio that works with [Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) should work.
* If you have any updates or would like to add to this list, issue a PR.
